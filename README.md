Lol-Firewall-Fix

League of Legends Firewall Fix made by Stevecaboose

This is a simple tool to delete the Logitech dll files that cause the firewall bug error. This should only be used if you
have the firewall error pop up every once in a while. If you use logitech devices such as keyboards which somehow interact
with League of Legends, this will mostly likley cause that device's special functions with League stop working. This will never
break your game. These files are not required to run your game. They are the culprit for many problems which is why I made this
tool to help.

1. Click on LoL Firewall Fix.
2. Download as raw.
3. Click on delete Logitech files.
4. Done

Ive included the source code in the "Main" folder for anyone who would like to make sure that this file does what I claim it does

----NOTES----

You must run this program after every patch.
This will not work if you did not install in the default directory. If you installed on a different drive that is fine. Just a different directory will cause the program to not find the files it needs.

Enjoy :)
